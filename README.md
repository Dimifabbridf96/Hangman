## How to play:

The user is welcomed with a message then:

* To start the user need to enter his name
* The second choice that the user needs to do is the difficulty which can be easy(e) or difficult(d)
* At this point the program chooses a word that can be <7 if the user chooses easy mode or >7 if the hard mode
* From here the user chooses a letter every round to see if is part of the hidden word.
* If the letter is inside the word on the terminal is shown the current word with the letter guessed in the respective position
* Every round the lives increase (on√≤y easy mode) or decrease based on the presence or not of the letter in the word
* Same thing for the coins
* If the number of lives reaches 0 there are 2 possible consequences:
    1. If the user has enough coins (10 for easy mode and 20 for hard mode) can spend them to receive 5 (e) or 3 (d)
    2. Else if the user doesn't have enough coins the game finish and the user can restart the game
* Finally if the user wants to close the program can answer 'N' on the input at the end of the match.
